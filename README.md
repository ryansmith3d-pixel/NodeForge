# NodeForge

**A semantic graph system for VFX and AI workflows — and a proof of concept for a thesis about how production AI tooling should actually work.**

---

## The Argument

Current AI tools fail in VFX production environments because they lack semantic context, deterministic behavior, and explicit state management. Probabilistic models are fundamentally in tension with the requirements of production pipelines, which demand reproducibility, auditability, and reliable communication of intent across technical and artistic teams.

The fix is not better prompts or bigger models. It is explicit structure.

VFX pipelines solved this problem decades ago: represent the work as a directed graph of typed, parameterized nodes with defined data and control flows. The graph is the source of truth. Every operator — human, tool, or agent — reads from and writes to that structure. The system is inspectable, serializable, and deterministic by design.

NodeForge applies that same architecture to AI agent workflows, and asks: what does AI tooling look like when it is built the way a production pipeline engineer would build it?

---

## What This Is

NodeForge is a Python-based semantic graph system. It represents VFX pipeline stages and AI agent operations as nodes in a unified, typed, JSON-serializable graph. The graph is the single source of truth. CLI, agents, and (optionally) UI are all operators on that graph — none of them own state.

The system supports:

- VFX pipeline nodes (`LoadAsset`, `ApplyShader`, `ShaderValidate`, `RenderComparison`, `LookApproval`)
- AI agent nodes (`LLMCall`, `VectorRetrieve`, `Evaluator`, `Router`, `MemoryUpdate`)
- Mixed hybrid pipelines that combine both domains under the same architecture

Both kinds of node are represented identically. There is no special-casing.

### Core design decisions

**The graph never executes code directly.** It describes execution. The execution engine interprets it. This separation is what makes the graph inspectable, serializable, and agent-safe.

**Edge types are open strings, not a closed enum.** `DATA` and `CONTROL` are the standard types. Phase 10 introduces causal semantics (`MODULATES`, `DRIVES`, `OCCLUDES`, `EMITS`, `PROJECTS_TO`). The schema was designed for this from Phase 3.

**Node domain is metadata, never a structural constraint.** VFX and AI nodes are typed with labels — they are not structurally different kinds of objects. The same executor handles both.

**Handlers are registered, not imported.** The execution engine looks up handlers by node type string. It never imports handler modules directly. New node types require no changes to the executor.

**`summarize_intent()` is purely algorithmic.** The query layer can describe what a subgraph does and where it might fail without an LLM call. Deterministic output for deterministic input. An LLM-assisted layer is planned for Phase 9 — layered on top, not substituted in.

## What You Can Do With It Right Now

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/ryansmith3d-pixel/NodeForge.git
cd NodeForge
uv sync
uv pip install -e .

# Run
uv run nodeforge stats                        # Pipeline statistics as JSON
uv run nodeforge workflows                    # Full graph manifest
uv run nodeforge validate path/to/graph.json  # Validate any graph file
uv run nodeforge check                        # Integrity + cycle detection
uv run nodeforge query downstream node_03     # Downstream traversal
uv run nodeforge query upstream node_05       # Upstream traversal
uv run nodeforge query topo                   # Topological execution order
uv run nodeforge query intent                 # Semantic intent summary

# Test
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

## The Thesis Connection

The goal of this system is to make a concrete argument about AI tooling in production environments.

A graph that can be serialized to JSON and reconstructed without loss is a graph an agent can safely read and write. A query layer that can answer "what does this subgraph do and where might it fail?" without an LLM call is a system that does not depend on probabilistic inference to reason about its own state. An execution engine that records failure in graph state rather than raising an exception is a system that remains inspectable after something goes wrong.

These are architectural properties, not features. They are what production pipeline engineers have required for decades, and what current AI tooling largely does not provide.

NodeForge is a proof of concept for what it looks like when you build AI-operable systems the way a pipeline engineer would build them.
