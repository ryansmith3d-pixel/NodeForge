# Phase 2 Summary — Project Structure & Reusability

## What Was Built
The package was refactored into a proper module hierarchy. Logic was extracted from the CLI into a `core` subpackage with clean, importable functions. External behavior is unchanged — the refactor is verified by identical output before and after.

## Project Structure
```
E:\projects\nodeforge
│   pyproject.toml
│   .python-version
│   README.md
│
└───src
    └───nodeforge
            __init__.py
            main.py          ← CLI only, all logic removed
            pipeline.py      ← can be deleted (superseded by core/)
            core/
                __init__.py  ← exposes core symbols
                pipeline.py  ← sample data (moved here)
                graph.py     ← graph operations (new)
```

## Key Decisions

- **CLI is now dumb** — `main.py` only imports and formats. No loops, no logic. This is permanent: the CLI is a view on core, never the owner of behavior.
- **`core/` is the importable surface** — anything that needs to operate on a graph (tests, agents, other modules) imports from `nodeforge.core`. The entry point is irrelevant to that.
- **`graph.py` functions take a `graph: dict` argument** — they are stateless and pure. They do not own or store the graph. This is intentional: the same functions will work on any valid graph dict, whether it came from a file, a fixture, or an agent mutation. Prepares cleanly for Phase 3 where the dict becomes a typed model.
- **`core/__init__.py` controls the public API** — only what is explicitly imported there is considered stable. Internal structure of `core/` can change without breaking callers.
- **`get_node` returns `dict | None`** — not an exception on miss. Agents querying for a node that doesn't exist should get a clean null, not a crash.

### `src/nodeforge/main.py`
```python
import json
import typer
from nodeforge.core import SAMPLE_PIPELINE, summarize

app = typer.Typer()


@app.command()
def stats():
    """Output pipeline statistics as JSON."""
    typer.echo(json.dumps(summarize(SAMPLE_PIPELINE), indent=2))


@app.command()
def workflows():
    """Output the full pipeline manifest as JSON."""
    typer.echo(json.dumps(SAMPLE_PIPELINE, indent=2))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
```

## Verified Working
```
uv run nodeforge stats      → identical JSON output as Phase 1
uv run nodeforge workflows  → identical JSON output as Phase 1
uv run python -c "from nodeforge.core import get_node, SAMPLE_PIPELINE; print(get_node(SAMPLE_PIPELINE, 'node_03'))"
→ {'id': 'node_03', 'type': 'ShaderValidate', 'params': {'rules': ['energy_conservation', 'normal_range']}, 'status': 'PENDING'}
```

## Next: Phase 3
Replace the `dict`-based graph with validated Pydantic models: `Node`, `Edge`, `Graph`. This is where the system gets an enforceable schema — the foundation for safe agent read/write, CLI validation commands, and typed tool interfaces.
