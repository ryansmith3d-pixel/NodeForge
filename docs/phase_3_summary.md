# Phase 3 Summary — Data Models & Typing

## What Was Built
The dict-based graph was replaced with validated Pydantic models. The system now has an enforceable schema — invalid graphs are rejected with structured error output. The CLI gained a `validate` command that round-trips any JSON file through the schema.

## Key Decisions

**`dict[str, Any]` for `params`** — deliberately loose for now. The Blueprint anticipates discriminated unions per node type in Phase 7+. Solving that in Phase 3 would have made the phase significantly larger without advancing the thesis. The field description documents the intent clearly enough for agents to reason about it.

**`inputs`/`outputs` omitted from `Node`** — these fields have no consumer until the execution engine in Phase 6. Optional fields with no current role are noise in the schema, not structure. They get added when they have a concrete job.

**`source`/`target` instead of `from`/`to` on `Edge`** — `from` is a Python reserved word. Aliasing around it is unnecessary friction. `source` and `target` are standard graph terminology and cleaner in every context.

**`get_node()` lives on `Graph` as a method** — pure lookup with no side effects belongs on the model. The standalone function in `graph.py` delegates to it, preserving the existing public API.

**`model_dump_json()` instead of `json.dumps()`** — Pydantic's own serializer handles the full model structure correctly. `json.dumps` doesn't know how to traverse a model object.

**`load_graph()` as the single entry point for reconstruction** — anything deserializing a graph from JSON goes through `Graph.model_validate()` via this function. One place to add migration logic, schema versioning, or pre-validation later.

## Verified Working
```
uv run nodeforge stats                      → pipeline statistics as JSON, identical to Phase 2
uv run nodeforge workflows                  → full graph as JSON with typed model fields
uv run nodeforge validate test_graph.json   → Valid — 5 nodes, 4 edges.
uv run nodeforge validate bad_graph.json    → Validation failed: version field required
```

## Amendments Closed
AMD-001 (Pydantic field descriptions) and AMD-003 (extensible edge type) are both satisfied. All model fields carry `Field(description=...)`. Edge `type` is an open `str`.

## Next — Phase 4.5
Phase 4 (UI) is explicitly deprioritized. Phase 4.5 — Graph Query & Analysis — comes next. This is where the graph becomes interrogable: traversal, dependency queries, cycle detection, and the foundation for the `summarize_intent()` tool from AMD-002. That's the layer that lets an agent reason over the graph before touching it.
