# Phase 4.5 Summary — Graph Query & Analysis

## What Was Built
The graph became interrogable. A dedicated query module adds traversal, dependency analysis, cycle detection, referential integrity validation, and a semantic intent summary. The CLI gained a `query` subcommand group and a standalone `check` command. Two open amendments (AMD-002, AMD-005) are now closed.

## Key Decisions

**`networkx` as the graph math layer** — not hand-rolled BFS. `nx.descendants`, `nx.ancestors`, `nx.topological_sort`, and `nx.simple_cycles` are battle-tested. Writing equivalents from scratch would be noise at this stage and a maintenance liability later. More importantly, networkx is a production-standard library that any downstream agent or tool will recognize.

**`_build_nx_graph()` as an internal helper** — every query function converts the NodeForge `Graph` into a `nx.DiGraph` internally. This is deliberately not exposed in the public API. The networkx graph is a transient analysis artifact, not a second source of truth. The NodeForge `Graph` model remains the canonical representation.

**`downstream`/`upstream` return unordered lists** — `nx.descendants` and `nx.ancestors` return sets. The order of results from these functions is not meaningful. `topological_sort` is the only traversal where order matters, and it is deterministic. If ordered display becomes necessary later (e.g. sorted by topo position), that is a Phase 7 concern.

**`summarize_intent()` is purely algorithmic** — no LLM calls inside the query layer. The open question from AMD-002 is resolved: algorithmic for now, LLM-assisted as an optional Phase 9 layer on top. Using an LLM inside the foundation would undercut the determinism thesis. The function must produce identical output for identical input, always.

**`critical_path` uses longest-by-node-count path** — `nx.shortest_path` between each source/sink pair; the longest result wins. This is a heuristic, not a weighted critical path. It is good enough for intent summarization and agent reasoning. A weighted version (by estimated execution time) is a Phase 6/7 candidate if needed.

**`control_gates` derived from edge type** — any node that is the *source* of a CONTROL edge is a chokepoint: its failure halts downstream execution. This is read directly from edge metadata, requiring no additional annotation. It reinforces why the DATA/CONTROL distinction introduced in Phase 1 was meaningful from the start.

**`validate_integrity()` lives in `query.py`, not `models.py`** — Pydantic validates models in isolation. Cross-object constraints (does this edge's target actually exist?) require graph-level visibility. That belongs in the analysis layer, not the schema layer. This was the design rationale behind AMD-005.

**`query` is a Typer sub-app** — `app.add_typer(query_app, name="query")` gives a clean `nodeforge query <subcommand>` namespace without polluting the top-level command list. Scales naturally as more query types are added.

## Amendments Closed

**AMD-002** — `summarize_intent(graph, node_ids=None)` implemented in `query.py`. Exposed via `nodeforge query intent`. Returns structured JSON describing domain, critical path, control gates, and failure state. Purely algorithmic.

**AMD-005** — `validate_integrity(graph)` implemented in `query.py`. Catches dangling edge references (source or target ID not present in node list). Returns structured result with specific errors identified. Exposed via `nodeforge check`.

## Verified Working
```
uv run nodeforge check
→ integrity valid, no cycles

uv run nodeforge query downstream node_01
→ ['node_05', 'node_04', 'node_02', 'node_03'] (unordered — correct)

uv run nodeforge query upstream node_05
→ ['node_03', 'node_02', 'node_01', 'node_04'] (unordered — correct)

uv run nodeforge query topo
→ ['node_01', 'node_02', 'node_03', 'node_04', 'node_05'] (deterministic)

uv run nodeforge query intent
→ domain: vfx, critical_path: [node_01..node_05], control_gates: [node_03]

uv run nodeforge --help
→ stats, workflows, validate, check, query all listed
```

## Thesis Connection
A graph that can't be questioned is just a data format. This phase is what separates NodeForge from a structured JSON file. `summarize_intent` in particular demonstrates the core claim: explicit semantic structure enables reasoning that no amount of probabilistic inference over raw node lists could replicate. An agent can call this function and receive a meaningful answer to "what does this subgraph do and where might it fail?" — without inspecting a single node individually.

## Next — Phase 5: Testing, Logging, Config
The system now has enough structure to be worth protecting. Phase 5 adds `pytest` coverage for the core and query layers, structured logging, and config loading. These are not glamorous — but they are what makes the system trustworthy enough to hand to an agent in Phase 8. An untested system is not a safe tool interface.
