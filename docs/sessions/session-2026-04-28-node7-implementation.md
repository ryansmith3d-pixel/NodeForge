# Idiograph — Session Summary
**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** FROZEN — historical record, do not revise
**Session type:** Implementation
**Branch:** feature/node7-community-detection (PR pending)

---

## Context

Node 7 (community detection) implementation against the living spec at
`docs/specs/spec-node7-community-detection.md`. Spec was untracked in the
working tree at session start and is included in this PR per the same
pattern as Nodes 5 and 6.

Prerequisites verified at session start:
- Baseline 144 tests passing.
- `PaperRecord.community_id: str | None` field already present at
  `models.py:69` from a prior session — no PaperRecord changes needed.
- `igraph` wheel for `cp313-win_amd64` confirmed available
  (`uv pip install igraph --dry-run` resolved to `igraph==1.0.0`) — Leiden
  is a viable fallback on the dev platform.

Scope: `detect_communities()` pure function with private `_run_infomap()`
and `_run_leiden()` helpers, the `CommunityResult` model, and the
`[community]` optional extra. No orchestrator wiring.

---

## What Was Built

### `pyproject.toml`

- New `[community]` optional extra: `["infomap", "leidenalg", "igraph"]`.
  Sits next to the existing `qt` extra.

### `models.py`

- New `CommunityResult(BaseModel)` inserted between `DepthMetrics` (top
  of file) and `PaperRecord` — groups both pipeline-result models
  adjacent at the top, before the central domain model and its dependent
  edge/cycle types. Fields: `community_assignments: dict[str, str]`,
  `algorithm_used: Literal["infomap", "leiden"]`, `community_count: int`,
  `validation_flags: list[str]` (default empty list).
- `Literal` import already present — no new import line.
- `PaperRecord` unchanged — `community_id: str | None` was already in
  place from a prior session.

### `pipeline.py`

One public function added after `compute_pagerank()` and before the
`ARXIV_PIPELINE` constant, with two private helpers:

```python
def detect_communities(
    nodes: list[PaperRecord],
    cites_edges: list[CitationEdge],
    infomap_seed: int = 42,
    infomap_trials: int = 10,
    infomap_teleportation: float = 0.15,
    leiden_seed: int = 42,
    community_count_min: int = 5,
    community_count_max: int = 40,
) -> CommunityResult: ...

def _run_infomap(nodes, cites_edges, seed, trials, teleportation) -> CommunityResult
def _run_leiden(nodes, cites_edges, seed) -> CommunityResult
```

Shape:
- Empty `nodes` short-circuits to a valid `CommunityResult` with
  `algorithm_used="infomap"`, `community_count=0`, empty assignments and
  flags. DEBUG log per spec §Logging. Mirrors the
  `compute_depth_metrics`/`compute_pagerank` early-return convention —
  no import attempt on empty input.
- Input validation: warn-and-skip per `compute_co_citations` pattern
  (`warned_missing` set, WARNING once per unknown id).
- Fallback policy: try Infomap; on `ImportError` try Leiden; raise
  `RuntimeError` with install-extras message if neither.
- Infomap path: `nx.DiGraph` built then handed to Infomap via
  `add_networkx_graph()`, which returns the `{internal_int: external_str}`
  mapping used to translate `get_modules()` results back to `node_id`s.
  `--two-level --silent --seed N` flags per spec.
- Leiden path: `igraph.Graph(directed=True)` with explicit integer-index
  round-trip; `g.add_vertices(len(node_ids))` runs before
  `g.add_edges(...)` so isolates are pre-registered.
- LOD validation: append-only flags after partition; never blocks.
- Section header `# ── Node 7 — Community Detection ──...` — 78 chars,
  matches existing Node 4/4.5/5/6 headers exactly.

### `tests/domains/arxiv/test_pipeline_node7.py`

15 tests, named verbatim from spec §Tests. Helpers (`_rec`, `_edge`)
inline at the top of the file following the Node 5/6 convention.
`_rec(node_id)` is minimal — Node 7 community detection has no
semantic dependence on `citation_count` or `root_ids`.

`test_missing_edge_node_warns` uses
`caplog.at_level(logging.WARNING, logger="idiograph.arxiv.pipeline")` —
the same logger string as the existing Node 5 test.

`test_suppressed_originals_merge` runs `clean_cycles` on a real cycle
fixture and assembles `cleaned_edges + [s.original for s in suppressed_edges]`
exactly as the orchestrator will, then passes the merged list to
`detect_communities` — integration-style coverage of the call-site merge
pattern, per spec.

## Style divergences from spec — flagged before writing

Two divergences where the existing codebase wins on style per the
implementation prompt's "If the spec and the existing code conflict on
style or convention, the existing code wins" rule:

1. **Log-message prefix.** Spec snippets use `"detect_communities: ..."`.
   Existing Node 4.5 / 5 / 6 logs use `"Node N: ..."` /
   `"Node N <subsystem>: ..."`. Implementation uses `"Node 7: ..."` and
   `"Node 7 complete: ..."` to match the existing convention. Behavior
   is unchanged.

2. **Empty-input early return.** Spec §Logging says "DEBUG log on empty
   input" but does not specify whether the function should attempt
   imports on empty input. `test_empty_nodes` requires
   `community_assignments=={}` and `community_count==0`, but
   `algorithm_used` is `Literal["infomap", "leiden"]` — must be one
   of those values. Implementation early-returns `algorithm_used="infomap"`
   on empty input *before* attempting any import. This mirrors the
   `compute_depth_metrics:719` and `compute_pagerank:804` `if not nodes:
   return {}` convention and ensures `test_empty_nodes` passes regardless
   of whether the optional `[community]` extra is installed.

Both flagged at the read-pass stage, not after-the-fact.

## Test Gate

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Tests passing | 144 | 159 |
| New tests | — | 15 |
| ruff check (touched files) | clean | clean |

`test_deterministic_same_input` ran 3 times in isolation via
`pytest --count=3` (pytest-repeat 0.9.4 added to `dev` deps to support
this validation step) — 3/3 passed, no flakiness observed. Infomap's
`--seed 42` is the determinism mechanism.

## Spec-compliance self-check

Mapping of spec §Contracts bullets to enforcing tests:

| §Contracts bullet | Enforcing test |
|---|---|
| Every node appears as a key in `community_assignments` | `test_all_nodes_assigned` |
| `community_count == len(set(community_assignments.values()))` | `test_community_count_matches_assignments` |
| Isolates receive an assignment | `test_isolate_receives_assignment`, `test_single_node_no_edges` |
| `algorithm_used` always set, never None | `test_algorithm_used_set` |
| `validation_flags` always a list, never None | `test_validation_flags_always_list`, `test_validation_flags_empty_within_bounds` |
| Unknown `node_id`s in `cites_edges` warned and skipped, never raise | `test_missing_edge_node_warns` |
| Empty input returns valid empty result | `test_empty_nodes` |
| Determinism on same input | `test_deterministic_same_input` (×3 via pytest-repeat) |
| Below-minimum threshold flag | `test_validation_flag_below_minimum` |
| Above-maximum threshold flag | `test_validation_flag_above_maximum` |
| Disconnected components all assigned | `test_disconnected_graph` |
| Call-site merge (`cleaned + suppressed.original`) shape | `test_suppressed_originals_merge` |
| Community ids are strings | `test_community_id_is_string` |
| `RuntimeError` on missing both libraries | `test_raises_when_neither_installed` (added post-CI; see below) |
| Leiden fallback when only infomap is missing | `test_leiden_fallback_when_infomap_missing` (added post-CI; see below) |

## Deviations from the spec

Two sanctioned deviations, named:

- **Spec file `docs/specs/spec-node7-community-detection.md` lands with
  this PR.** Same pattern as Nodes 5 and 6 (spec drops in the working
  tree at session start, lands with the implementation PR).
- **Two tests added beyond the spec's 15-test minimum set:**
  `test_leiden_fallback_when_infomap_missing` and
  `test_raises_when_neither_installed`. The spec's 15-test set does
  not exercise the Leiden fallback path or the no-libraries
  `RuntimeError` branch — both are unreachable when both libraries are
  installed (the normal local-dev state). `codecov/patch` flagged the
  resulting 71.42% patch coverage on first PR run; the threshold is
  89.07%. Mirroring Node 5's "Beyond the spec §Tests minimum set"
  section, these two tests use a `monkeypatch`-based
  `_patch_imports()` helper to simulate missing libraries and force
  the uncovered branches. Total Node 7 test count: **17** (15 spec +
  2 coverage closures).

No in-spec edits. No structural deviations.

## End-of-session validation (from prompt)

1. `git diff main --stat` — changes limited to:
   - `pyproject.toml` (`[community]` extra; pytest-repeat added to `dev`)
   - `src/idiograph/domains/arxiv/models.py` (`CommunityResult` added)
   - `src/idiograph/domains/arxiv/pipeline.py` (one new public function +
     two private helpers + section header + one new import)
   - `tests/domains/arxiv/test_pipeline_node7.py` (new, 15 tests)
   - `docs/specs/spec-node7-community-detection.md` (new, untracked at
     session start, included in this PR)
   - `uv.lock` (transitive resolver update for `[community]` extra and
     pytest-repeat)
   - `.github/workflows/tests.yml` (CI install step changed from
     `uv sync` to `uv sync --extra community` — the spec's
     §Dependencies command. Without it, 14 of 15 Node 7 tests raise
     the "neither infomap nor leidenalg installed" `RuntimeError`.
     Surfaced by CI failure on the first push of PR #25; load-bearing
     for the Node 7 test gate; included in this PR rather than split
     into a separate workflow-only PR.)
   - this session summary
2. All 15 tests in spec §Tests present by name — verified in `pytest -v`
   output, no test from the spec dropped or renamed.
3. `test_deterministic_same_input` passes 3/3 via
   `pytest --count=3` — not flaky.
4. Every node in `nodes` appears in `community_assignments` —
   `test_all_nodes_assigned` enforces via set equality, not assumed.
5. Section header comment 78 chars, matches lines 479, 603, 701 of
   `pipeline.py` exactly (verified via `awk` length check).

## What's Next

1. **Open PR** `feat(arxiv): Node 7 — community detection` against main.
   Reviewer signoff, merge.
2. **Node 7 spec freeze** once merged (per spec §Freeze trigger).
3. **Post-freeze sweep** (separate PR, per spec post-freeze list):
   - Update `spec-arxiv-pipeline-final.md` Node 7 section to reflect the
     implemented function pair and `CommunityResult` shape.
   - Update `BRIEFING.md` — Node 7 entry in What's Built, test baseline
     to 159.
4. **Orchestrator wiring** (`run_arxiv_pipeline()` to assemble
   `cleaned + [s.original ...]` and call `detect_communities`, then
   merge `community_id` onto each `PaperRecord` via `model_copy`) —
   separate design session, not part of any node spec.
